**You are editing UI code for the IOSD website.
The design language is cinematic, editorial, and expressive — not flat or static.**

---
While editing:
1. Move all hard coded data to lib/config
2. Respect existing component design principle that have been explained below. 
3. Always use globals.css appropriately whenever required

### Core Feel

* Calm, confident, *but alive*
* Premium tech / design-led engineering org
* Not playful, not boring, not SaaS-default

---

### Typography

* Inter for main text, JetBrains Mono for metadata
* Big text = light weight, large scale
* Small text = mono, uppercase, tracked
* Typography sets hierarchy; visuals support it

---

### Color Usage

* Grayscale-first, but **color is allowed**
* Brand accent (cool cyan `#67bed9`) is intentional and visible
* Use accent for:

  * hover states
  * glows
  * focus
  * progress
  * energy cues
* Avoid flat colorful backgrounds or loud gradients

> Color should **breathe**, not shout.

---

### Motion Rules

* Motion is **atmospheric and expressive**
* Inspired by:

  * testimonial transitions
  * animated cursor
  * dock magnification
* Motion can exist without interaction (ambient)
* No bouncy, playful, or gimmicky animations

Think *camera movement*, not *button effects*.

---

### Components

* Cards can react on hover (color shift, glow, magnetism)
* Interactive elements should subtly stand out
* Alumni = respectful but not lifeless
* Team = present, alive, approachable
* Avoid static “content blocks”

---

### Geometry

* Mostly sharp or neutral
* Rounded elements allowed **if intentional** (e.g. dock, cursor, focus rings)
* No random pills or bubbly cards

---

### Remove / Avoid

* Hardcoded colors
* Loud gradients
* Over-decoration
* Flat, dead sections
* SaaS marketing patterns

---

### Guiding Question (always check)

> “Does this feel cinematic and alive, or static and template-like?”

If it feels static — add *controlled energy*.
If it feels loud — remove noise.

---

### One-line summary
> **IOSD UI should feel designed, animated, and intentional — never flat, never flashy.**
